## Overview

In this tutorial, we will go over TensorBoard.

## What is TensorBoard?

TensorBoard is a visualization toolkit for TensorFlow (and other frameworks) that helps you understand, debug, and optimize your machine learning models.
It provides visual insights into your training process through interactive dashboards.

## How to use TensorBoard

<Steps>

### Install TensorBoard

It should come installed with tensorflow. You can check with

```bash
pip show tensorboard
```

If not already installed, then run:

```bash
pip install tensorboard
```

### Add code

To enable TensorBoard for your model training, you can use the following code:

```py
import tensorflow as tf
import datetime

# Define the log directory to store TensorBoard logs
log_dir = f"logs/fit/{datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d-%H%M%S')}"

# Define TensorBoard callback
tensorboard_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(log_dir=log_dir, histogram_freq=1)

# Fit the model with TensorBoard callback
# Im using ... to ignore the other arguments, add the actual arguments there.
model.fit(..., callbacks=[tensorboard_callback])
```

</Steps>

## Visualize with TensorBoard

After training your model, you can visualize with TensorBoard by running:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir <path to logs> 
```

With the example above, we would do:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir logs/fit 
```

Then, open your browser and go to the URL displayed in your terminal (or just click on it). The URL
is typically `http://localhost:6006`.
