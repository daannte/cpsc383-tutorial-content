## Overview

In this tutorial, we will learn some basic Prolog, a programming language widely used in AI, especially for tasks
that involve searching and reasoning. Prolog is a programming language based on formal logic. It uses facts, rules
and queries to find solutions. It's often used in problem-solving and natural language processing.

## Syntax

Now we will go over the prolog syntax.

### Atoms (Constants)

Atoms represents fixed values or simple facts. They are usually written in lowercase.

For example:

```prolog
apple.
john.
alice.
dog.
```

They can also be written as strings enclosed in single quotes.

```prolog
'Table'.
'New York'.
```

### Variables

Variables are placeholders that can represent any value. They start with an uppercase letter or an underscore. 

For example:

```prolog
X.
Y.
_var.
```

When prolog encounters a variable, it tries to assign it a value that satisfies the rules or facts in the program.

### Predicate

Predicates are used to express relationships or properties about objects. It's made up of a name followed by parentheses.

For example:

```prolog
likes(john, pizza).
father(X, Y).
```

You might see `predicate/arity` often, where `predicate` refers to the name of the predicate, and `arity` indicates the number of arguments
the predicate takes. From the example above, the predicate `likes(john, pizza)` can be referred as `likes/2`

### Horn Clauses

Horn clauses are a type of rule used to represent logical inferences. They are typically written as:

```prolog
Head :- Body.
```

The part before the `:-` is called the head, which represents the goal. The part after the `:-` is the body, which
consists of one or more conditions that must hold true for the goal to apply.

There are 2 forms of horn clauses:

#### Facts

Facts are basic statements about the world. They represent knowledge in the form of simple, unconditional statements.
They are horn clauses with no body.

```prolog
parent(john, alice)
```

The fact states that john is parent of alice.

#### Rules

Rules define relationships between facts. They specify conditions under which something is true.
They are a horn clause with both head and body.

```prolog
boy(john) :- son(john, alice)
```

The rule states that john is a boy if john is son of alice.

## Example

```prolog
edge(a, b).
edge(a, c).
edge(b, d).
edge(c, d).
edge(d, e).

dfs(Start, Goal, [Start|Path]) :- 
    edge(Start, Next),
    dfs(Next, Goal, Path).

dfs(Start, Goal, [Start, Goal]) :- 
    edge(Start, Goal).
```

- The `edge/2` facts defines the edges in the graph.
- The first `dfs/3` predicate recursively explores the graph from `Start` to `Goal`.
- The second `dfs/3` predicate serves as the base case. When there's a direct edge from `Start` to `Goal`, it returns the path.

Let's query the database to find a path from `a` to `e`:

```prolog
?- dfs(a, e, Path)

% Results:
% Path = [a, b, d, e]
% Path = [a, c, d, e]
```

### Why Prolog Returns Multiple Results

The reason Prolog returns two different paths is because Prolog uses top-down depth-first search (DFS) combined with backtracking.

### What happens during the search?

When you run the query:

```prolog
?- dfs(a, e, Path).
```

Prolog tries to find a path from `a` to `e` using the rules defined in the `dfs/3` predicate. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

<Steps>

### Prolog will first try to match the first `dfs/3` clause:

```prolog
dfs(Start, Goal, [Start|Path]) :- 
    edge(Start, Next),    
    dfs(Next, Goal, Path).
```

This clause tells Prolog that, to find a path from `Start` to `Goal`, it needs to look for an edge from `Start` to some `Next`, and
then recursively find a path from `Next` to `Goal`. So, for `dfs(a, e, Path)`, Prolog will start by trying to find an edge from `a` to `Next`.

### Exploring Edges from `a`

If there is more than one edge starting from `a`, Prolog will try both possibilities one by one. In the above example, we have `a -> b` and `a -> c`.
First, it will try `a -> b`, and then it will try `a -> c` when backtracking happens.

### Recursion continues

In the first case (`a -> b`), prolog will attempt `dfs(b, e, Path)`. It will then try to find an edge from `b` to some `Next`, and continue the search. In
this case, we find the edge `b -> d`. We now continue with `dfs(d, e, Path)`. If Prolog finds an edge from `d` to `e`, it will match the second `dfs/3` clause:

```prolog
dfs(Start, Goal, [Start, Goal]) :- 
    edge(Start, Goal).
```

This will return the path `[d, e]`, which is the base case.

### Path Construction

Prolog will now backtrack to build the full path:

1. Path = `[b, d, e]`
2. Path = `[a, b, d, e]`

We finally have the complete path from `a` to `e`.

### Other possibilities

Prolog will now try and find other possibilities. As we know from earlier, we have `a -> c`. Prolog will repeat the entire process, and get us
the other path: `[a, c, d, e]`.
