## Overview

In this tutorial, we will set up a Python environment and AIML files to build a basic chatbot. You will learn how to define patterns, use wildcards, and add random responses to your bot,
giving it the ability to interact more naturally.

## Learning Goals

- Understand the structure of AIML and how it is used to define chatbot behavior.
- Set up a Python environment and install necessary packages to run AIML-based chatbots.
- Create and modify AIML files to define patterns and responses.
- Modify a chatbot to personalize responses and handle various input scenarios.

## AIML Setup and Introduction

Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML) is a simple XML-based language used to create chatbots. It allows developers to define patterns (what the chatbot looks for) and responses
(how the chatbot responds). AIML provides a framework for making rule-based chatbots, such as the well-known ALICE chatbot.

<Steps>

### Create a Virtual Environment

Open your terminal and run the following commands:

<Tabs defaultValue="mac/linux">

<TabsList>

<TabsTrigger value="mac/linux">Mac/Linux</TabsTrigger>
<TabsTrigger value="windows">Windows</TabsTrigger>

</TabsList>

<TabsContent value="mac/linux">

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv 
source .venv/bin/activate
```

</TabsContent>

<TabsContent value="windows">

```bash
python -m venv .venv 
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

</TabsContent>

</Tabs>

### Install the AIML package

Once inside the virtual environment, install the `python-aiml` package using pip:

```bash
pip install python-aiml
```

</Steps>

Now that we have everything setup, we need to create the AIML files that define the chatbot's behaviour. You'll need 3 files:

1. `bot.py`: This is the Python script that will run the chatbot. 
2. `std-startup.xml`: This is the main entry point for loading AIML files.
3. `basic_chat.aiml`: This is where we define the chatbot’s patterns and responses.

Let's now create these files.

<Steps>

### Create `std-startup.xml`

The `std-startup.xml` file is the configuration entry point that tells the chatbot what AIML files to load when it starts.
This file will include a `learn` tag to load the AIML files you create later.

Create a new file named `std-startup.xml` and copy the following into the file:

```xml
<aiml version="1.0.1" encoding="UTF-8">
    <!-- std-startup.xml -->

    <!-- Category is an atomic AIML unit -->
    <category>

        <!-- Pattern to match in user input -->
        <!-- If user enters "LOAD AIML B" -->
        <pattern>LOAD AIML B</pattern>

        <!-- Template is the response to the pattern -->
        <!-- This learn an aiml file -->
        <template>
            <learn>basic_chat.aiml</learn>
            <!-- You can add more aiml files here -->
            <!--<learn>more_aiml.aiml</learn>-->
        </template>
        
    </category>

</aiml>
```

### Create `bot.py`

The `bot.py` file will be the Python script that loads the AIML files and runs the chatbot.
This is where the chatbot actually gets initialized, and it listens for user input.

Create a new file named `bot.py` and copy the following Python code into it:

```py
import aiml

# Create the kernel and learn AIML files
kernel = aiml.Kernel()
kernel.learn("std-startup.xml")
kernel.respond("load aiml b")

while True:
    print(kernel.respond(input("Enter your message >> ")))
```

### Create `basic_chat.aiml`

The `basic_chat.aiml` file is where we define the chatbot's patterns (what the chatbot looks for in the user's input)
and templates (how the chatbot responds).

Create a new file named `basic_chat.aiml` and add the following content:

```xml
<aiml version="1.0.1" encoding="UTF-8">
    <category>
        <pattern>HELLO</pattern>
        <template>
            Well, hello!
        </template>
    </category>
    
    <category>
        <pattern>WHAT ARE YOU</pattern>
        <template>
            I'm a bot, silly!
        </template>
    </category>
</aiml>
```

</Steps>

## Testing Your Chatbot

Once you’ve created all three files (`std-startup.xml`, `bot.py`, and `basic_chat.aiml`), you can run the chatbot.

1. Make sure all your files are in the same directory as the `.venv`.
2. Run the `bot.py` script:

```bash
python bot.py
```

## Understanding AIML Syntax

Below is an explanation of the key components of AIML syntax that you’ll use to build and enhance your chatbot.

### Key Components

#### `<category>`

The `<category>` element is the basic building block of AIML. It defines a pattern-response pair. Each `<category>`
contains a `<pattern>` and a `<template>`.

Example:

```xml
<category>
    <pattern>HELLO</pattern>
    <template>
        Well, hello!
    </template>
</category>
```

#### `<pattern>`

The `<pattern>` tag defines the exact words or phrases the chatbot listens for in user input. The content between the `<pattern>` tags must be all caps.
AIML patterns are case-insensitive when interacting with the chatbot, and you can use wildcards to match multiple inputs.

###### Wildcards

- `*`: Matches any sequence of words.

Example:

```xml
<pattern>WHAT IS YOUR NAME</pattern> <!-- Matches "What is your name" -->
<pattern>MY NAME IS *</pattern> <!-- Matches any name after "My name is" -->
```

#### `<template>`

The `<template>` tag defines the response the chatbot gives when it detects a matching pattern. 

Example:

```xml
<category>
    <pattern>HOW ARE YOU</pattern>
    <template>I'm doing great, thank you for asking!</template>
</category>
```

#### `<random>`

The `<random>` tag allows you to define multiple responses for a single pattern. The chatbot will choose one response at random from the list each time it matches the pattern.
This helps make the chatbot's responses feel more natural.

Example:

```xml
<category>
    <pattern>HOW ARE YOU</pattern>
    <template>
        <random>
            <li>I'm doing great, thanks!</li>
            <li>I'm good, how about you?</li>
            <li>I'm feeling awesome today!</li>
            <li>Not too great.</li>
        </random>
    </template>
</category>
```

## Your Turn

For your participation, you must modify the chatbot to meet the following goals.

### Make the Chatbot Respond With Your Name

Create a pattern that will make the chatbot respond with `Hello, <Your full name>`. 
For example, if your full name is _John Doe_, the chatbot should respond:

```py
# Bacon is the trigger in this example.
Enter your message >> bacon
Hello, John Doe
```

### Using Wildcards and Random Responses

For the second task, pick a pattern that utilizes wildcards (the `*` wildcard) and random responses to make the bot respond differently based on user input.

Here’s an example of using a wildcard to catch anything after the phrase "One time I" and respond randomly:

```py
Enter your message >> one time i went to the park
Are you telling the truth?
Enter your message >> one time i fell down the stairs
Try to tell me that another way.
```

### What to submit

For this participation, you’ll need to submit an image that shows both the AIML code and the chatbot interaction demonstrating that your modifications are working.
