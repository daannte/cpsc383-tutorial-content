## Overview 

In this tutorial, we will explore some classic and modern chatbots, reflect on what makes AI different from humans,
and consider the key ideas from the Turing Test. Let's dive into some famous chatbots, reflect on their design, and 
test your understanding with a fun game at the end.

## Learning Goals:

- Understand the Turing Test and its significance in AI.
- Explore historical and modern chatbots and analyze how they mimic human conversation.
- Reflect on the differences between AI and human intelligence.
- Test your ability to distinguish between humans and AI.

## Review of the Turing Test

The Turing Test is one of the most famous concepts in AI, proposed by British mathematician Alan Turing in 1950.
It is a way to measure a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to that of a human.

In the Turing Test, a human is placed in one room and a machine another. A judge, who is also in separate room, will
ask questions regarding any topic to each room. If the machine can convince the human judge
that _it's_ human, or if the human judge cannot distinguish betwen the human's and machine's responses, then the machine
has passed the Turing Test.

Passing the Turing Test is a goal for many AI systems, but it remains difficult because AI still lacks many
elements of human cognition, such as emotional intelligence.

The Loebner Prize is an annual competition based on the Turing Test, where developers compete to create the most "human-like" chatbot.
It’s interesting to note that despite many years of advancements, no chatbot has yet convincingly passed the Turing Test in the sense that Turing proposed it.

## Meet the Chatbots

Now that you have an understanding of the Turing Test, let’s look at some famous chatbots. These bots represent different stages of chatbot
development and are great examples of how AI has tried to replicate human conversation.

### ELIZA (1966)

ELIZA was one of the first chatbots ever created. Developed by Joseph Weizenbaum, it simulated a Rogerian psychotherapist and was able to
converse with users by recognizing keywords and responding with pre-defined patterns. Although simple by today's standards, ELIZA marked
an important first step in chatbot development.

### ALICE (1995)

ALICE (Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity) was a more sophisticated chatbot developed by Richard Wallace. Using an advanced set
of pattern-matching rules, ALICE could engage in more complex conversations. It won the Loebner Prize three times, demonstrating how far chatbot
technology had come in a few decades.

### Eugene Goostman (2001)

Eugene Goostman was a chatbot designed to simulate a 13-year-old Ukrainian boy. In 2014, Eugene Goostman famously fooled 1/3 of the judges at the
Loebner Prize into believing it was human. While its success was limited, it sparked debate about what it truly means for a machine to "pass" the Turing Test.

Unfortunately, the website for Eugene Goostman is no longer available, but you can read about it on its [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Goostman).

### GPT-4 (2023)

GPT-4, developed by OpenAI, is one of the most advanced chatbots in existence today. It can understand and generate human-like text with incredible fluency. Unlike earlier chatbots,
GPT-4 uses large language models trained on vast amounts of data, enabling it to engage in a wide variety of conversations.

## Group Exercise: Chatbot Comparison

Now it’s time to test your understanding of how these bots work and the differences between them.

### Group Activity:

1. In small groups, take some time to interact with the chatbots from the list above.
2. Reflect on the following questions:
   - How is the chatbot similar to a human? What aspects were the developers aiming to copy or achieve?
   - How is it different from talking to a human? Are there any specific things that stood out to you in your conversation with the bot?
   - Could you tell the difference between the bot and a human if you were participating in a Turing Test?

### Key Questions to Consider:

- What aspects of the conversation make the bot seem human (e.g., empathy, humor, complexity)?
- Were there any moments where the bot seemed robotic?
- Based on your interactions, could you tell the difference between a bot and a human?
