## Overview

In this tutorial, you will build an autoencoder for the MNIST dataset.

## What is an Autoencoder?

An autoencoder is a neural network designed to compress input data into a smaller representation 
and then reconstruct the original input from that compressed form.

An autoencoder consists of three key components:

<Steps>

### Encoder

This part of the network compresses the input into a lower-dimensional representation. In this tutorial,
the input is a flattened 784-pixel image (28x28), and the encoder compresses it to a smaller number of neurons.

### Bottleneck

The middle layer, often called the bottleneck, contains a reduced set of features representing the most important information from the input.
The idea is that through this compression the network learns the key patterns and structures of the input data.

Experimenting with different values (100, 10, and 2) will show how this affects reconstruction quality.

### Decoder

This part reconstructs the original input (28x28) from the encoded representation. Ideally, the decoder should produce an output
as close as possible to the original image.

</Steps>

Since we are comparing pixel values between the original and reconstructed images, we need to use a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function rather
than crossentropy since we are no longer comparing probabilities. MSE measures how much the reconstructed image deviates from the original by
averaging the squared differences across all pixels.
