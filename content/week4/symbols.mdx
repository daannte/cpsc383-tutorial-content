## Overview

In this tutorial, you will be helping to create the dataset that will be used in the AEGIS
system for your third assignment.

## Download script and Setup

Head over to D2L and download the `symbols_code` zip.

We'll have to create a venv to download some packages that are required to use the `symbols.py` script.

<Steps>

### Create a Virtual Environment

Open your terminal and run the following commands:

<Tabs defaultValue="mac/linux">

<TabsList>

<TabsTrigger value="mac/linux">Mac/Linux</TabsTrigger>
<TabsTrigger value="windows">Windows</TabsTrigger>

</TabsList>

<TabsContent value="mac/linux">

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv 
source .venv/bin/activate
```

</TabsContent>

<TabsContent value="windows">

```bash
python -m venv .venv 
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

</TabsContent>

</Tabs>

### Install packages

Once inside the virtual environment, install the following packages using pip:

```bash
pip install Pillow numpy 
```

</Steps>

## Tkinter error

If you are using Mac or Linux you might run into the following error:

```bash
import _tkinter # If this fails your Python may not be configured for Tk
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_tkinter'
```

To fix this, you'll have to use a package manager to install `tkinter`.

<Tabs defaultValue="mac">

<TabsList>

<TabsTrigger value="mac">Mac</TabsTrigger>
<TabsTrigger value="linux">Linux</TabsTrigger>

</TabsList>

<TabsContent value="mac">

You'll have to install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/), and then install the `python-tk@3.12` package.

<Steps>

### Setup Homebrew

Run the following in your terminal:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### Install tkinter

Once homebrew is installed, run the following in your terminal:

```bash
brew install python-tk@3.12
```

</Steps>

Once everything is installed, delete and remake the virtual environment.

<TabsContent value="linux">

You'll have to install the appropriate package for your distribution 
(e.g., `python3-tk`, `python3-tkinter`, or `tk`).

Once everything is installed, delete and remake the virtual environment.

</Tabs>

## Running the script

In the symbols folder, run `python symbols.py`, and follow the instructions on the screen.

If you're using dark mode on your system, switch to light mode when drawing,
as the lines you make won't be visible.

## Participation

Submit the `symbols.npy` file to the D2L dropbox.
