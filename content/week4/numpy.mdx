## Overview

In this tutorial we will be doing an introduction to Numpy and a few exercises to get
familiar with the module.

## Install packages 

You'll be able to use the following virtual environment for the second part of the course, as
these are all the packages you'll need.

<Steps>

### Create a Virtual Environment

Open your terminal and run the following commands:

<Tabs defaultValue="mac/linux">

<TabsList>

<TabsTrigger value="mac/linux">Mac/Linux</TabsTrigger>
<TabsTrigger value="windows">Windows</TabsTrigger>

</TabsList>

<TabsContent value="mac/linux">

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv 
source .venv/bin/activate
```

</TabsContent>

<TabsContent value="windows">

```bash
python -m venv .venv 
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

</TabsContent>

</Tabs>

### Install packages

Once inside the virtual environment, install the following packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib pandas 
```

</Steps>

## Intro to Tensors

### What is a tensor?

A tensor is a generalization of matrices and vectors to higher dimensions. You can think of a tensor as a container
that holds data in the form of a multidimensional array. Here's how the dimensions break down:

- **Scalar**: A 0-dimensional tensor (a single number e.g. `8`)
- **Vector**: A 1-dimensional tensor (e.g. `[3, 5, 7]`)
- **Matrix**: A 2-dimensional tensor (e.g. `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]`)
- **Higher-Dimensional Tensor**: A 3D tensor and beyond. (e.g. `[[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]]`)

In NumPy, tensors are implemented as `ndarrays`, which stands for "n-dimensional arrays."

### Creating Tensors

You can create tensors in NumPy using the `numpy.array()` function. Here's how you can create different types of tensors:

#### Creating a Scalar

```py
import numpy as np

scalar = np.array(8)
print(scalar)

# Output:
# 8
```

#### Creating a Vector

```py
import numpy as np

vector = np.array([3, 5, 7])
print(vector)

# Output:
# [3, 5, 7]
```

#### Creating a Matrix

```py
import numpy as np

matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
print(matrix)

# Output:
# [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
```

#### Creating a Higher-Dimensional Tensor

```py
import numpy as np

tensor_3d = np.array([[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]])
print(tensor_3d)

# Output:
# [[[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]]]
```

#### Creating Tensors with Ones, Zeros, and a Range

You can also use special functions to create tensors filled with ones, zeros, or specific ranges of numbers.

##### Ones

Creates a tensor filled with ones.

```py
ones = np.ones((2, 4))
print(ones)

# Output:
# [[1. 1. 1. 1.]
#  [1. 1. 1. 1.]]
```

##### Zeros

Creates a tensor filled with zeros.

```py
zeros = np.zeros((2, 4))
print(zeros)

# Output:
# [[0. 0. 0. 0.]
#  [0. 0. 0. 0.]]
```

##### Arange

Generates a tensor with a range of values.

```py
range_tensor = np.arange(0, 10, 2)  # Start, stop, step
print(range_tensor)

# Output:
# [0 2 4 6 8]
```

### Tensor Arithmetic

NumPy allows you to perform mathematical operations on tensors just like you would with matrices, vectors, integers, etc. 
Operations can be element-wise, matrix multiplication, and more.

#### Element-wise Operations

```py
import numpy as np

tensor1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
tensor2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])
result = tensor1 + tensor2
print(result)

# Output:
# [5 7 9]
```

#### Matrix Multiplication

<Admonition title="Multiplication" variant="caution">
Using `np.dot()` does not perform element-wise multiplication, if you want to do that use `np.multiply()`. 
</Admonition>

```py
import numpy as np

matrix1 = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
matrix2 = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
result = np.dot(matrix1, matrix2)
print(result)

# Output:
# [[19 22]
#  [43 50]]
```

**Reminder on Matrix Multiplication**: Matrix multiplication is done by taking the dot product of rows and columns. The element at the position (i, j) in the result matrix
is calculated by multiplying the i-th row of the first matrix by the j-th column of the second matrix and summing the products.

Example:

<Steps>

### First row, First column:

`(1 * 5) + (2 * 7) = 5 + 14 = 19`

### First row, second column:

`(1 * 6) + (2 * 8) = 6 + 16 = 22`

### Second row, first column:

`(3 * 5) + (4 * 7) = 15 + 28 = 43`

### Second row, second column:

`(3 * 6) + (4 * 8) = 18 + 32 = 50`

</Steps>

The result of the matrix multiplication is:

```py
[[19 22]
  [43 50]]
```

#### Scalar Multiplication

```py
import numpy as np

tensor = np.array([1, 2, 3])
result = 2 * tensor
print(result)

# Output:
# [2, 4, 6]
```

### Indexing and Slicing

NumPy allows you to easily access and manipulate specific elements or sub-arrays within a tensor.

#### Indexing a Scalar

Scalars cannot be indexed as it's just a number.

#### Indexing a Vector

```py
vector = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print(vector[1])

# Output:
# 2
```

#### Indexing a Matrix

```py
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
print(matrix[1, 1])

# Output:
# 4
```

#### Indexing (Why it's different)

The difference from regular Python lists is that NumPy allows you to specify both row and column indices at once. This is also
the recommended way to access NumPy arrays as it's also faster because the Python way will actually create a new temporary array.

```py
# Do
matrix[1, 0]

# Don't
matrix[1][0]
```

#### Slicing 

```py
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
print(matrix[0:2, 1:3]) 

# Output:
# [[2 3], [5 6]]
```

**Slicing Explanation**: In the example above, the syntax `[0:2, 1:3]` means:

- Take rows from index 0 up to (but not including) index 2, and
- Take columns from index 1 up to (but not including) index 3.

You can also extract full rows or columns from a matrix. Here's how to do it:

##### Full Rows

```py
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

row = matrix[1, :]
print(row)

# Output:
# [4 5 6]
```

**Explanation**:
- `matrix[1, :]` means "get all elements of the row at index 1."
- The colon `:` means get all columns in that row.

##### Full Columns

```py
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

column = matrix[:, 1]
print(column)

# Output:
# [2, 5, 8] 
```

**Explanation**:
- `matrix[:, 1]` means "get all the elements of the column at index 1."
- The colon `:` means get all rows of that column.

### Shape

The `.shape` attribute returns a tuple representing the dimensions of a tensor. 
This is useful to understand the structure of the data you're working with.

```py
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
print(matrix.shape)
# Output:
# (2, 3)
```

This tells you that the matrix has 2 rows and 3 columns.

<Admonition title="Shape" variant="info">
A shape of `(500,)` represents a 1D array with 500 elements, while `(500, 1)` represents a 2D array with 500 rows and 1 column. The key difference is that
`(500,)` is a vector, while `(500, 1)` is a column vector (still a 2D array).
</Admonition>

### Reshape Function

The `.reshape()` function allows you to change the shape of a tensor without changing its data.
For example, you can turn a 1D vector into a 2D matrix.

```py
vector = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
matrix = vector.reshape(2, 3)  # Reshaping the vector into a 2x3 matrix
print(matrix)

# Output:
# [[1 2 3]
#  [4 5 6]]
```

When reshaping you must ensure that the number of elements remain the same. For example, if you are reshaping a vector of length 8,
you must reshape it into a matrix where the total number of elements is also 6 (e.g. `2x4`, `4x2`, `2x2x2`).

<Admonition title="Reshaping with -1" variant="info">
Using `-1` in `reshape()` allows NumPy to automatically infer the size of that dimension based on the other specified dimensions. This helps when you don't want to manually calculate the size of one dimension, while ensuring the total number of elements remains the same.
</Admonition>

### Vectorize

In NumPy, vectorization refers to the ability to perform operations on entire tensors without the need for explicit loops. This makes code more efficient and concise,
as it takes advantage of low-level optimizations in NumPy.

We can use the `np.vectorize()` to apply custom functions.

Here's an example:

```py
def square(x: int) -> None:
    return x ** 2

square_v = np.vectorize(square)

x = np.arange(5)
res = square_v(x)
print(res) 

# Output: 
# [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
```

## Exercises

### Shape of Tensors

What is the shape of each of the following tensors?

- `5`
- `[[1, 2], [5, 6]]`
- `[1, 2, 3]`
- `[[[0], [0]], [[0], [0]], [[0], [0]]]`

### Create Tensors

Create the following tensors:

- A `2x3` tensor with random values from a uniform distribution over `[0, 1)` (Look for something in `np.random`)
- A tensor of shape `(5,)` containing all zeros

### Modify Tensor Entries

Create a `4x4` tensor of all ones, and then set the entries at positions `(2, 2)` and `(2, 3)` to 5. Print the result.

### Add Tensors

Create a new `4x4` tensor of all ones and add it to the tensor from the previous question. Print the first column of the result.

### Add Function

Use the following function to add 2 to all entries in your answer from the previous question and print the result.

```py
def add2(x: int) -> int:
  return x + 2
```

### Element-wise Multiplication

Create the tensor:

```py
np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
```

Multiply it by itself entry-wise and print the value at position `(1, 0)` in the result.

### Rotate Column

Take the first column of your answer from the previous question and rotate it so it becomes a row vector.
Print the result. Confirm the objectâ€™s shape. Is this a 1D or a 2D vector? Can you change it from one to the other?
