<Admonition variant="danger" title="Wrong Information">  
Last tutorial I said that the input was the `(x, y)` point and label, and the output was the line for the perceptron.
That's wrong (this is what happens when you talk about lines for 20min). The input is the `(x, y)` point and the output is the label, `-1` or `+1`.

## Overview

In this tutorial, we will go over SVMs and Polynomial Regression.

## SVMs (Support Vector Machines)

As a rough overview, the goal of an SVM is to find a linear classifier for a dataset, just like the perceptron.
The main difference is that the perceptron will stop learning once it has found ***any*** correct solution. SVMs, on the other hand, will look for the linear classifier
with the widest margin, the _best_ solution in a sense. 

<Admonition variant="caution" title="Kernels">  
A large part of the power of SVMs has to do with kernels (embedding the problem into a higher-dimensional space), but we wonâ€™t go there for the purposes
of this tutorial, as it is outside the scope of this class.

### Understanding the Margin

A useful way to think about SVMs is to imagine drawing the widest road between two groups of data points, ensuring that it separates them as well as possible.
The median of this road is the final solution.

### SVM Simulation

You can experiment with a SVM simulation here:

To start with, set `v` to the lowest possible value. This value is the regularization parameter, which indicates how tolerant the model
is towards misclassified data points.

## Polynomial Regression

Polynomial regression involves fitting a polynomial function to a dataset. It extends linear regression by allowing the relationship between the independent variable
(`x`) and the dependent variable (`y`) to be represented as an nth-degree polynomial. This flexibility enables the model to capture non-linear trends in the data that
a simple linear model might miss. When predicting a new input, it plugs into the polynomial to estimate the corresponding output.

### Study Example: Hours of Study vs. Exam Performance

Imagine you are studying for an exam, and you want to understand how the number of hours you study (`x`) affects your exam score (`y`). Initially, you might assume that more
study hours always lead to better performance. However, after a certain point, the increase in performance might start to level off, or even decrease if you study too much and
get fatigued.

For example, let's consider this data:

<Table>
  <TableCaption>Study Hours vs. Exam Score</TableCaption>
  <TableHeader>
    <TableRow>
      <TableHead>Hours of Study (x)</TableHead>
      <TableHead>Exam Score (y)</TableHead>
    </TableRow>
  </TableHeader>
  <TableBody>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>1</TableCell>
      <TableCell>55</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>2</TableCell>
      <TableCell>60</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>3</TableCell>
      <TableCell>65</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>4</TableCell>
      <TableCell>75</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>5</TableCell>
      <TableCell>85</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>6</TableCell>
      <TableCell>95</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>7</TableCell>
      <TableCell>98</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>8</TableCell>
      <TableCell>97</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>9</TableCell>
      <TableCell>90</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
  </TableBody>
</Table>

A simple linear regression model might fit the data, but it wouldn't capture the leveling-off effect that happens after a certain number of study hours. Polynomial regression,
on the other hand, could fit a curve to this data, where the relationship between study hours and exam score is non-linear. This model would better reflect the fact that increasing
study hours does not always lead to linear improvements in performance.
